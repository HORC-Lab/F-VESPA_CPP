This test is implementing unit tests for the implemented Butterworth filter and the real-time kinematic-based foot-strike detection algorithm F-VESPA.
This test invokes only one process that utilizes a ButterworthFilter object and a FootStrikeDetector object.
The calculated values are compared with the ground-truth values and corresponding messages are printed to the console.
This test can run in any computer and there are no dependencies to other software.
