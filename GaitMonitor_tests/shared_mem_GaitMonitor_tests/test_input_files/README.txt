Input files were generated from real trials recorded using Vicon Nexus during walking on the VST2. 
Each file contains four columns: 
	1) Frame number from Vicon Nexus
	2) Y-coordinate of left heel marker (sagital)
	3) Z-coordinate of left heel marker (vertical)
	4) Last foot-strike frame calculated using an offline version of F-VESPA in MATLAB
